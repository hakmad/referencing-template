# referencing-template
A LaTeX template for generating references.

This template can be used for generating references for essays which are
formatted correctly and in order. I use this for writing references for my
girlfriend, who writes their essay in Word - the generated references can be
appended to the essay without too much hassle.

## Usage

- [ ] Add references to `bibliography.bib`.
- [ ] Compile LaTeX file with `make`.
- [ ] Clean up ancilliary files with `make clean`.
- [ ] Copy references in `references.pdf` to Word document.
